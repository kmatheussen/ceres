Ceres 0.56 -> 0.57
------------------
-Added check for patch


Ceres 0.55 -> 0.56
------------------
-Changed default resynthesis save type to IFFT.
-Small build fix.


Ceres 0.54 -> 0.55
------------------
-Compiles on 64 bit Ubuntu 10. Huge thanks to Menno for
 help testing.
-Various build improvements


Ceres 0.53 -> 0.54
------------------
-Use newer config.guess and config.sub files in glib
 and gtk. Thanks to Menno for reporting the bug.


Ceres 0.52 -> 0.53
------------------
-Fixed a couple of crashes when playing.


Ceres 0.51 -> 0.52
------------------
-Included gtk1 and glib1 in build. Seems like Ubuntu/Debian doesn't
 provide gtk1 anymore.


Ceres 0.50 -> 0.51
------------------
-Various build fixes.
 Thanks to Hermann Brummer and Dave Phillips for
 bug reports and help locating potential problems
 on Debian/SID and Ubuntu.


Ceres 0.49 -> 0.50
------------------
-Included libxml. Not available in repos for Ubuntu.
 Thanks to Hermann Brummer for the report!


Ceres 0.48 -> 0.49
------------------
-Various build fixes.
 (Thanks to Ebrahim Mayat!)


Ceres 0.46 -> 0.47
------------------
-Various makefile fixes


Ceres 0.45 -> 0.46
------------------
-Fix to make pygtk1 build for Python 2.5. Bug found by Dave Phillips.


Ceres 0.44 -> 0.45
------------------
-Changed so that pygtk1 and libglade are compiled up when writing
 "make" and installed when writing "make install". This makes it
 much easier for linux distribution package maintainers.


Ceres 0.42 -> 0.44
------------------
-Fixed some compiling problems for gcc 4.0.1.
-Give warning about the additiv resynthesis. It might not
 produce correct result.
-Disabled built in support for jack. Sndlib does a much
 better job supporting jack than ceres.
-Included latest version of sndlib. The previous included version
 seemed to segfault the program at startup. Well, works now.


Ceres 0.41 -> 0.42
------------------
-Fixed some bugs in the Makefile.


Ceres 0.41 -> 0.42
------------------
-Actually apply the fix for the (horrible) bug that caused
 ceres to crash on newer linux distributions. (Sorry!)


Ceres 0.40 -> 0.41
------------------
-Fixed a (horrible) bug that caused ceres to crash on newer linux
 distributions.
-Simplified the install process a lot. pygtk1, libglade and sndlib
 is now included in the distribution and is/can be installed
 automatically if needed.
-Connect to jack-server right after starting up ceres, not right
 before playing for the first time.


Ceres 0.39 -> 0.40
------------------
-The BPM image loader segfaulted, and was generally buggy. Hopefully fixed.
-Standard number of LPC poles was set to 5 instead of 50. Typo. Fixed.
-LPC->Filter current spectrum and LPC->Inverse filter spectrum did not
 store undo data before processing. Fixed.
-Added a progressbar when creating temporary files for large sounds.


New in Ceres 0.38 -> 0.39
-------------------------
-Doing realtime preview made ceres segfault if jack server was not
 running. Fixed.
-Values for the control function nodes is written in the editor.
 Values are not shown if "Show node values" is unchecked in the preferences
 window.


New in Ceres 0.37 -> 0.38
-------------------------
-Updated default Jack port names from
 alsa_pcm:[out/in]_* to alsa_pcm:[playback/record]_*
-Test for pygtk2 instead of pygtk1, and writes a message
 to stdout about what to do if pygtk2 is installed instead of pygtk1.
-Made the Save button in the preference window also update
 current settings. Less confusing.
-Increased max number of soundchannels from 4 to 8.
-Added option to choose between "ceres" and "ceres-<pid>"
 for the jack client name.
-Wrote an explanation how to install ceres on a machine with
 pygtk2 instead of pygtk1.


New in Ceres 0.36 -> 0.37
-------------------------
-Fixed broken LPC.
-Fixed very serious bugs in the "sieve", "Spectrum shift"
 and "Spectral subtraction" transforms. Bugs introduced
 in V0.30.
            *They should now sound as they should.*
 Oops.
-Fixed a semi-serious bug in the convolve transform.
-Added "make install" to the makefile. Set the "INSTALLPATH"
 variable in the makefile.
-Removed some debug printings.


New in Ceres 0.35 -> 0.36
-------------------------
-Removed a bug that caused the gain transform to not work very well.
-Added cut, copy and paste in the edit menu. Works the same as in Ceres3.
-Added credits to Johnathan F. Lee (Ceres2) and Stanko Juzbasic (Ceres3)
 in the about dialog. Previously, some credits where only mentioned in
 the source.
-Added sndlib.a and sndlib.h to the distribution. Static oss/linux compiled.
 (sndlib.a seems to be a bit troublesome to compile up sometimes.)
-Added note about a common problem regarding pygtk in the INSTALL file
 that usually makes ceres crash. 


New in Ceres 0.34 -> 0.35
-------------------------
-Removed limitation in size of PBM ascii image to load.
-Fixed a bug when loading PBM ascii images.
-Added support for libsndfile V1. (V0 is still supported too.)
-Removed some compiler warnings.


New in Ceres 0.33 -> 0.34
-------------------------

-Fixed a Segfault if doing a realtime preview of a transform without
 having played earlier.
-Removed the <stdbool.h> replacement code which was added by a mistake
 in 0.33.


New in Ceres 0.32 -> 0.33
-------------------------

-Fixed time-stretching. Time-stretch did not work
 in any of the 0.3x versions.
-Open file file-requester shows info about the soundfiles.
-Fixed the default-values in the makefile, which was
 wrong in 0.32.


New in Ceres 0.31 -> 0.32
-------------------------

-Fixed compiling issues with Jack. (Old jack-types used)

-Added option to change paint size.




New in Ceres 0.30 -> 0.31
-------------------------

-Preview and Preview Realtime did only work properly with
 mono sounds. Fixed.

-Preview, Preview Realtime and Play wasn't allways stopped
 before doing other things (they are threaded). Could cause segmentation fault.
 Hopefully fixed.

-Made it possible to play while undoing and redoing.

-Included the forgotten Ceres.ad file.

-Made the Makefile a bit easier to edit.

-Full support for LessTif.

-Made it easier to compile up and run Ceres.

New in Ceres 0.15 -> 0.30
-------------------------

-Optimized additiv resynthesis function. ~3 times faster on IA32.

-Double buffer graphics.

-Improved Graphical control for the control functions.

-Improved GUI. 

-All 16bit/24bit/32bit/float/double soundformats (ao. wav and aiff)
 supported by libsndfile is supported. ( http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/ )

-Realtime playing of current soundbuffer.

-libsnd support.

-jack support.

-libaudio support (for the SGI, untested)

-Preview of all transforms. (Limited length)

-Realtime preview of all transforms. Its a hack, and full quality is not
 gained. But one gets a good impression for most of the transforms.

-Matlab export function. (Quite equal to the csound export function)

-Large soundfiles stored on disk instead of memory. Very little
 speed-loss (about 1% slower for idedma/scsi-disks) because
 of this, except for some transforms (blur, shear,
 average, warp and spectrum shape) that needs to reorganize all data before and after processing.
 The reorganizing takes about the same time it takes to save a file
 using IFFT resynthesis 16 times (rough guess, disk access is what takes time).
 The alternative is to let blur, shear, average, etc. use about window-size/2 times
 longer time to process, or let everything take twice as much time.
 Processing shorter sounds, which is stored in memory, does not
 have to reorganize data, and takes the same time as before.

-Ported the warp and spectrum shape transforms from ceres3.

-Configurations can be saved in $(HOME)/.ceres.

-More configuration options.

-Unlimited or limited undo and redo.

-Made it harder to compile up and run Ceres.
